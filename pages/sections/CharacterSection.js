        As a creative thinker, I constantly develop ideas that stand out to
        peers and professionals. At work, I am friendly and sociable, making me
        adaptable to any and all tasks whether done individually or
        collectively. Likewise, I teach with creative analogy, especially when
        it comes to theoretical and practical concepts. During my free time, I
        spend the day creating 3D art and publishing game-related content.
